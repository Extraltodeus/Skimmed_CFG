# Skimmed_CFG
A powerful anti-burn allowing much higher CFG scales for latent diffusion models (for ComfyUI)

CFG below at: 6/8/12/16/24/32, skimming scale at 6

Simply plug after the model loader (same for all the fours nodes):

## nodes: 
- Skimmed CFG: My version first version of this, works like a charm!
- Skimmed CFG - replace: replace the values within the negative by those in the positive prediction, nullifying (actually giving an equivalent scale of 1) the effect of values targeted by the filter.
- Skimmed CFG - linear interpolation: instead of replacing, does a linear interpolation in between the values. Highly recommanded!
- Skimmed CFG - linear interpolation dual scales: Two scales. One named "positive" and one.. well "negative". The name is more related to a visualy intuitive relation rather than fully from the predictions. A higher positive will tend to go towards high saturations and vice versa with the other slider.
- Skimmed CFG - Difference CFG: Other algorithms based on changes depending on the scale. Brings back what goes too far in comparison.

## special option (first node only):
- full_skim_negative: fully skim some part of the conflicting influence.
- disable_flipping_filter: the skimming CFG will have much more control. It is meant to be used with the full_skim_negative toggle on. (the last image of this readme is an example)

## Side-effects:

- better prompt adherence
- sharper images
- less mess / more randomness due to less conflicts in between the positive and negative predictions
- something something sometimes fused fingers with too low skimming CFG scale and too low amount of steps.


## Tips:

- The skimming scale is basically how much do you like them burned. 3 was the intended scale but suit to your needs.
- The SDE samplers can still burn a little but much less
- The SDE samplers can still totaly do nonsense with low steps
- A too low skimming scale may require to do more steps
- Recommanded skim: 2-3 for maximum antiburn, 5-7 for colorful/strong style. 4 is cruise scale.
- a good negative prompt is a style negative prompt
- to use super high scales it is not a bad idea to cut the negative before the end. You can find in [this repository](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/pre_cfg_comfy_nodes_for_ComfyUI/tree/main) a node named "Support empty uncond". Plug it after the skimmed cfg node. Then menu>advanced>conditioning>ConditioningSetTimestepRange and set the and at ~65%. This will avoid potential artifacts.



# Pro tip:

[It would be actually nice to have some support!](https://www.patreon.com/extraltodeus) because like this I will continue to share my findings!

Did you know that my first activity is to write creative model merging functions?

While the code is too much of a mess to be shared, I do expose and share my models. You can find them in this [gallery](https://github.com/Extraltodeus/shared_models_galleries)! üòÅ
